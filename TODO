* More tests: Especially: Continuations, finishScene, remoteActors
* Rewrite continuations such that multiple hooks may be registered
    - Requires tags on messages
    - just part or StageActor state all the time, set on matching, transferred
    on send, open issue: gc, alt: read up on channels..
    - unclear: define goal and scenario first!
    - maybe completely kill what is in place now
* Find out how all this scala testing sw can be used (scala check, scala spec whatnot)
* Performance comparison between "pull-type-rpc" and "sofleuse"
* Maybe identical code in both styles to show-off much better readability
* Demo/Slides!
