* More tests: Especially: Continuations, finishScene
* Find out how all this scala testing sw can be used (scala check, scala spec whatnot)
* Performance comparison between "pull-type-rpc" and "sofleuse"
* Maybe identical code in both styles to show-off much better readability
* Think about how this may work with RemoteActors..
* Demo/Slides!
