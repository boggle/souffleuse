* More tests: Especially: Continuations, finishScene, remoteActors
* Maybe introduce views for abstracting out responder construction and message sending
* Rewrite continuations such that multiple hooks may be registered
* Find out how all this scala testing sw can be used (scala check, scala spec whatnot)
* Performance comparison between "pull-type-rpc" and "sofleuse"
* Maybe identical code in both styles to show-off much better readability
* Demo/Slides!
